# Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise

An Android app that is made in kotlin that retrieves data from a url.

## Requirements
- [X] Display all items grouped by list
- [X] Sort the results by "listId" and then by "name"
- [X] Filter out any items where "name" is blank or null.

## Libraries in Use
- Kotlin Coroutines
  - Simplify asynchronous programming by providing a more concise and readable way to handle background tasks without blocking the main thread
- Hilt
  - Comprehensible dependency injection library, making it easier to manage and provide dependencies, improve code modularity, and enhance testability with less boilerplate code.
- Retrofit
  - Easily manage HTTP requests and responses, transforming them into Kotlin objects for smooth and efficient network operations.
- LiveData
  -  Build reactive and data-driven user interfaces, enabling automatic updates of UI components when underlying data changes, while also managing lifecycle awareness to prevent memory leaks and crashes.
- RecyclerView
  - Efficiently display large sets of data in a list or grid format, providing dynamic and smooth scrolling performance while optimizing memory usage by recycling views.
- GSON
  - Serialize Kotlin objects to JSON and vice versa, simplifying the handling of JSON data from APIs by mapping it directly to Kotlin objects without manual parsing.
